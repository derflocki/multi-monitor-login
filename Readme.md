## Multi Monitor Login Fix

In gnome-shell, the login and unlock dialogs are always placed on the primary monitor. This extension allows the user
to move the dialogs.

* The dialogs follow your mouse
* `[Control]+a` moves the dialogs to the next monitor
* `[Control]+{Number}` moves the dialog on a specific monitor.

## Installation

> These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 24.04. 

As of September 2024, to enable extensions for gdm:
1. the extension **must** be installed in `/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions/` (depends on your distribution)
2. it has to be enabled:
    ```bash
    sudo machinectl shell gdm@ /bin/bash
    dconf reset -f /
    gsettings set org.gnome.shell enabled-extensions "['multi-monitor-login@derflocki.github.com']"
    ```
